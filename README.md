-# Discord cloner.

``INFO``

- All clones are stored locally on your system or your system of choice;
  being as each clone is 5kb-100kb this shouldn't be an issue, if needed
  I will make an altenative for those of you who like to use databases,
  In the mean time it will remain as locally stored.

- This isn't the most advanced as of now it's for developers to work off
  of, stuff like checking who made the clone and who can use it will be
  implemented when I next update the bot in this repo.

```


Update is due to happen within the next `1-2` weeks, I've added more features such as;

/clone-delete
!mci {reference} (p) p=public 
^^^^
Mod Clone Info

!mclist {reference}
^^^^^^^
Mod Clone List

/info { temporary }

```
